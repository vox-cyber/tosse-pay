 * Canonical lifecycle states for a transaction row.

 * PENDING      — payment initiated, dial in progress or awaiting bank SMS
 * SUCCESS      — bank SMS confirmed the debit
 * FAILED       — bank SMS reported a failure/decline
 * CANCELLED    — call ended before the IVR flow could complete, or dial failed
 * UNVERIFIED   — call completed but no bank SMS arrived within the deadline;
 *                the money may or may not have moved — the user must check
 *                with their bank
 * NEEDS_REVIEW — a bank SMS confirmed *something* during this payment, but
 *                its amount didn't match what was sent — the user must verify
 *                against their bank statement before trusting the outcome
