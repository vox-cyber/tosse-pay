/**
 * One place that decides how a rupee amount is grouped.
 *
 * The same ₹1,00,000 used to render three different ways depending on which
 * surface showed it (observed on a real device, 2026-08-01):
 *  - history/home/detail  `₹1,00,000.00`  — correct
 *  - payment result screen `₹100,000.00`  — `String.format("%,.2f")`
 *  - result notification   `₹100000.00`   — raw string interpolation
 *
 * `String.format("%,…")` is the trap: its `,` flag takes only the *separator*
 * from the locale and always groups in threes, so it cannot produce the
 * Indian 3-2-2 pattern no matter which Locale is passed.
 *
 * The grouping is implemented here rather than delegated to
 * `NumberFormat.getInstance(en-IN)`, which looks like the obvious answer and
 * is not one. On Android that call is backed by ICU and does produce
 * `1,00,000.00`; on a plain JVM — which is where the unit tests run — the
 * JDK's own locale data groups `en-IN` in threes and returns `100,000.00`.
 * Verified on JDK 17: `getInstance`, `getCurrencyInstance`, and even `hi-IN`
 * all group in threes. Leaving the rule to platform locale data therefore
 * meant the one thing worth pinning could not be tested at all, and could
 * shift with an OEM's ICU build. `java.text.DecimalFormat` is no escape
 * either — it supports a single grouping size, so the pattern `#,##,##0.00`
 * silently degrades to `1,234,567.00`.
 *
 * Twelve lines of explicit grouping are cheaper than that, and they behave
 * identically on every device and in CI. India-only is a deliberate product
 * constraint here, not an oversight: see the README.
 *
 * Returns digits only — callers supply the ₹ through
 * `R.string.amount_rupees`, so the symbol has one source too.
