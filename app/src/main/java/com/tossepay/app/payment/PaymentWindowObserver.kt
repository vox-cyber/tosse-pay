/**
 * Closes the SMS operation window when a payment is cancelled.
 *
 * The window is [TransactionDetector]'s SharedPreferences-backed record that
 * a payment is in flight; while it is open, an arriving bank SMS may be
 * claimed as this payment's confirmation. Cancelling used to end the
 * *session* without closing the *window*, leaving it armed for the rest of
 * its 10.5-minute life — so a later same-amount debit (the user re-paying
 * through another app, say) was adopted onto the cancelled row and flipped
 * it to SUCCESS.
 *
 * Every cancel route — the overlay's terminate button, the never-connected
 * watchdog, a call that ended before the IVR flow could finish, a failed
 * dial — funnels into [PaymentSessionManager.finishSession] and emits
 * [PaymentState.Cancelled], so observing that one state closes them all;
 * [PaymentSessionManager] keeps its deliberate independence from
 * [TransactionDetector].
 *
 * Deliberately *not* triggered by [PaymentState.Timeout]: the window
 * outlives the verification deadline by 30 seconds on purpose, so a
 * slow-but-genuine confirmation still lands. Closing it at the deadline
 * would discard an SMS that did arrive. It expires on its own.
 *
 * The state→action decision is the pure, unit-tested [shouldDisarmSmsWindow];
 * only the disarm itself touches Android.
