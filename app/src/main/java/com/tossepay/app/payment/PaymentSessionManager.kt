 *  3. A confirming bank SMS ([onSmsConfirmed]) is the only path to SUCCESS.
 *     Call duration is never treated as proof of payment.
 *  4. If no SMS arrives before the deadline the row is discarded. A payment
 *     the bank never confirmed is one this app cannot report on, so it
 *     leaves no record rather than an outcome the user can't act on.
 *
 * Stale PENDING rows from a killed process are discarded lazily via
 * [reconcileStalePending] (app start, history open, next begin()).
